My knowledge of real estate law, collections, probate law and procedure helps me help my clients in several aspects of injury cases.  Whether researching the owner of property in premise liability cases or the probate court procedure necessary to settle a minor child's injury case, my broad knowledge base is instrumental in getting cases resolved with satisfactory results.
